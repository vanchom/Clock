There are two options to display the time in this app:

There are two buttons here; one shows analog clocks and the other shows digital clocks.

For both clocks, I have used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

To build the analog clock, I created a setClock and a setRotation function.

For the digital clock, I divided the day into two parts: AM and PM, so it would be easy to read the time.
